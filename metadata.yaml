abstract: "‘Object Detection meets Knowledge Graphs’ [1] by Fang et al. describes a framework
which integrates external knowledge from knowledge graphs, or background knowledge,
into object detection. They apply two different approaches to quantify background
knowledge as semantic consistency. An existing object detection algorithm is re‐optimized
with this knowledge to get updated knowledge‐aware detections. The authors of [1]
claim that this framework can be applied to any existing object detection algorithm
and that this approach can increase recall, while maintaining mean Average Precision
(mAP). In this work, the framework is implemented and the experiments are conducted
as described in [1], such that the claims can be validated."
